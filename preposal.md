# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My orignial idea was to go for a randomized guessing game to where you would have to take guesses on what the thing was and if you asked for a hint it would select the correct one but I didn't have enough time to do that so I just went with a choose your own adventure.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't plan to work with anyone 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I am not exactly sure how to minimilize the project so that it doesn't just look like a whole bunch of craziness
